**1. PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT**

**Introduction**
My choice to enroll in the Computer Science program was driven by a number of things. First, my love of technology in general and computers specifically established a healthy level of base interest. Second, its application to my current work as a Controls Engineer gave a utility-based argument to seeing it through to the end; this would mean both enhancing my skill set from a functional perspective as well as enhancing my resume to prospective future employers. Third, realization of my dreams of working in software development and possibly video game development would necessitate this stepstone. These factors combined have given me great motivation towards completion of the program and ensuring I gather all I could from the experience.<br>
When I entered the CS program at SNHU, I possessed a fair bit of knowledge and experience with computer science and other peripheral fields such as machine controls and robotics, as well as experience in a few programming languages. This gave me a sense of comfortability as I started each course, especially in the early stages. Even though the amount of new knowledge I gained in these first courses was rather minimal, it helped to solidify my confidence with each topic. As I progressed into more complex subject matter, I began to add new skills and understandings that were built upon the earlier subjects. This sense of progression was a very satisfying experience and gave a wider breadth of visibility into the field. As more and more topics were covered, the big picture of software architectures, environments, and implementations began to take shape.<br><br>
**Personal Strengths**<br>
This understanding of the big picture and how the various elements of software are connected is what I see as my greatest strength thus far. While I have more experience and knowledge in certain aspects such as database utilization or code structures, I believe the greatest value long-term is to understand how a piece of software will live in the real world and in real application. When learning a new subject (especially one that interests or fascinates me), I tend to drive down to the base principles, gathering structural understanding on the way. This idea of “First Principles” is not a new one, but I have found it to have great utility and value.<br>
By understanding how all elements are connected, diagnosing and troubleshooting issues becomes much easier. It also allows improvements to be made to existing systems and facilitates the implementation of new features or connections to other applications.<br>
Possessing an attention to detail and the willpower to realize full, in-depth understandings has provided me with many opportunities and success in my professional endeavors; the CS program has only validated these attributes and emboldened me to continue with their development. In addition, it has emboldened my existing values of honesty and forthrightness in my life as a whole. When implemented, these values allow for the most optimal development of a person, an organization, or any project undertaken by either; the lack of either only detracts from forward progress and achievement.<br>
<br>
**Education, Implementation and Realization**<br>
As an industrial and scientific field, I see Computer Science as a multi-faceted toolset for creation and problem-solving. It presents a means to develop new abilities and solutions for individuals and groups, reaching all the way up to the societal and civilizational levels. <br>
Throughout the CS program, we acquire the basic understanding of its various subjects such as algorithms and data structures (CS300), databases (DAD220), client-server development (CS340), operating platforms and various architectures (CS230, CS360), graphics and visualization (CS330), and the code that connects it all together (IT140, CS210). This builds us into individuals capable of utilizing all that CS has to offer to bring new products into the world, as well as maintain and improve existing works.<br>
While we as individuals are important and essential, our true potential is realized through cooperation with others and communication with those outside of our field. For this reason, the principles of collaborative work were also covered. We are shown and gain experience with organizational project management tools like Agile Development (CS250) and facilitation tools like Version Control, providing the framework for team-based development. We are tasked with communicating complex technical systems to nontechnical audiences to facilitate cooperation in real-world business environments where software development is only one part of the picture.
Additional essential skills and understandings are also instilled to help us thrive professionally. In an ever more connected world, security of computer systems plays an ever more essential role. We learn to think with a security mindset and employ data segmentation and cryptography in support of this goal (CS305). With the prospects of AI growing ever more capable and integrated with society, we are given the base understanding of Digital Neural Networks and Machine Learning to better understand its inner workings and potential (CS370).<br>
With knowledge and experience acquired and a suite of tools in hand, I feel very confident rolling out from the educational arena into the professional one. While this is not my first step in this direction, my experiences at SNHU in the Computer Science program have given me a new lease on my career prospects and opened me to many new potential paths both professionally and intellectually. I am confident in my abilities in the field, both technically and interpersonally. I am eager to apply all that I have learned to real work with real benefits and outcomes. While I’m positive that unforeseen challenges will always lay ahead, I look forward to hitting them head-on and overcoming each and every one in turn.<br>
<br>
**Technical Artifact Enhancement**<br>
Exemplification of the aforementioned abilities has been accomplished via the CS Capstone, of which this self-assessment is part and parcel. This consists of three separate enhancement tasks, taking previous work in the program and improving upon it in three specific areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases.<br>
As I hold the holistic view of any endeavor in high regard, I elected to apply all three enhancements to a single project. This allowed me to gain experience applying all of the lessons learned and topics covered in tandem with one another, mirroring likely work in the industry of software development (interest in which I mentioned above). This presented unique challenges in ensuring all work overlapped well and development in one area did not detract from the others.<br>
The base artifact being improved is a C++ console application, specifically a college course catalog management program. It possessed limited functionality, an organized yet monolithic code base, and no database implementation. This base state provided sufficient room for improvement and refinement in all three areas, allowing for ready exemplification of my skills in the field.<br>
<br>
**Course Outcome #1 Exemplification: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science**<br>
Given the solitary nature of this capstone, it may be assumed that completion of this outcome would be challenging. However, by displaying an overarching understanding of collaborative work and its importance, a solid foundation can be laid for this goal. By maintaining an open mind ready to employ constructive criticism and exemplifying such in individual work, it can be shown that one is ready to undertake the same quality of work in any professional collaborative environment where such behavior is essential to the success of the particular organization and its goals.<br>
<br>
**Course Outcome #2 Exemplification: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts**<br>
Exemplification of this outcome is done through composition of both this self-assessment as well as the code review and enhancement narratives below. While in this case the target audience is more technical in nature, the same endeavor could readily be undertaken with a less-technical audience in mind.<br>

**3. ENHANCEMENT 1: Software Design and Engineering**

**ARTIFACT SELECTION**
- **Artifact:** ABCU Advising Program
- **Description:** This program provides course list storage for the CS department at ABCU (fictional) to assist with admissions and administrative functions.
- **Justification:**  This artifact was included for the opportunity it provided for holistic application development and iterative improvement. As a complete application with all code available and minimal external library dependency, exercises in improvement would be easily comprehensible and understandable. Additionally, the initial state of the program (monolithic code) provided an excellent opportunity to exemplify program code structures and the interaction between multiple files and data structures.

**PROCESS**<br>
**Course Outcome Exemplified: #4 - Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals**<br>
Exemplification of this outcome is accomplished via the targeted implementation of a computer solution to the goal specified by the purpose of the program. Well-founded techniques were employed to do so, including the use of header and source files, formatted and standardized code and code structures. Individual functional components were abstracted out to human-readable functions, allowing the program’s sequence of events to be more self-evident. This facilitates future development and interpretation by future developers responsible for maintenance and improvements.<br><br>
**How artifact was improved:**
- The major class of BinarySearchTree was broken out to its own source and header files. The required structs of Node and Course were also relocated to the BinarySearchTree source file for proximal use.
- An additional class titled AdvisingProgram was created. All ancillary functions for the program were relocated here. Additionally, a main function titled executeProgram() was created to encompass the primary program loop. The remaining functionality in the primary source file has been reduced down to initial argument parsing, instantiation of the AdvisingProgram object, and execution of the main function.
- In order to further break down the main loop, the function of SearchAndPrintCourse() was added and the associated code was extracted.
- Library inclusions for the program were relocated to the baseline location requiring them. Any subsequent locations where these libraries are referenced are able to pull them via inclusion of the primary file.
By performing the actions above, the resulting code base is organized, more modular, and easier to interpret and understand.<br><br>

**REFLECTION**<br>
I found the refactoring process to be highly rewarding. While I had a certain sense of cleanliness initially building the program as one file, this excluded the prospects of enhancement or refactoring at the time. With that mechanism in place, the new code is much more organized. Not only do I find the new structure easier to visualize, the groundwork is now laid for the other enhancements pending on this artifact.<br>
Major challenges encountered during the refactoring included language-specific requirements for class structures and the use of pointers and references in a few new locations to facilitate functional operation.<br>
The result of execution has been a deeper understanding of the language used (C++) and a greater appreciation for planning out programming projects ahead of code implementation to facilitate future development.

**4. ENHANCEMENT 2: Algorithms and Data Structures**

**ARTIFACT SELECTION**
- **Artifact:** ABCU Advising Program
- **Description:** This program provides course list storage for the CS department at ABCU (fictional) to assist with admissions and administrative functions.
- **Justification:**  This artifact was included for the opportunity it provided for holistic application development and iterative improvement. As a complete application with all code available and minimal external library dependency, exercises in improvement would be easily comprehensible and understandable. In addition, this program was originally built to exemplify the use of flexible and efficient data structures; specifically the Binary Search Tree (BST) in this case. By adding new functionality and improving on existing functionality, the high performance of the BST could be either reinforced or invalidated.

**PROCESS**<br>
**Course Outcome Exemplified: #3 - Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices**<br>
Exemplification of this outcome is accomplished via utilization of new purpose-built algorithms as well as the integration of existing logic within the program. Utilizing the concepts of abstraction and modularity, well-defined functions are created which support implementation of the intended functions while minimizing duplication of code or obfuscation of code functionality. Given that some functions would be redundant, overly convoluted or run contrary to the original purpose of the program, any function that fits these descriptors was not included, thereby exemplifying the management of trade-offs.<br><br>

**How artifact was improved:**<br>
Three new functions were added to the main menu of the program: 
- Add Course: This function allows the insertion of individual courses to the BST in active memory by defining the Course ID, Description, and Prerequisite Courses. Validation logic is included to preclude the insertion of Course ID’s already present in the tree utilizing existing search functionality. 
- Disable/Enable Course: This function allows the user to search for an existing Course ID and toggle the new “enabled” parameter in the Course data structure.
- Run Course Validation: This function iterates through the entire BST, validating that each prerequisite of each course is present and enabled using the preexisting Search functionality.. Any exceptions to this are noted.
Boolean value “enabled” was added to the Course struct to allow courses to be disabled at will without affecting the active memory data structure (future work with Database inclusion may facilitate a rebuilding of the BST if and when appropriate).
The function for loading data from a CSV file has been modified to check for the existence of a Course ID prior to insertion into the BST. This ensures that no duplicate Course ID’s are inserted while allowing the individual addition of courses to occur before or after the bulk data insertion of this function.<br><br>

Execution timers/tick counters added to the following functions:
- Printing of full course list
- Printing of individual courses<br><br>

**Course Validation**
- **Optimization:** with these timers added, evaluation of the efficiency and execution time of the program and its various functions is possible. The bulk course list CSV file was augmented to a total of 100 courses, the functionality was executed and the results analyzed. This produced execution times at worst directly proportional to the data size, with the longest execution taking 0.1 seconds or 99 ticks when running the full Course Validation function. This function is recursive through the list of courses in the BST as well as performing a search through the BST for each prerequisite of each course, providing the highest amount of computational demand currently offered. Such results show promise; considering that the course list for a given institution is unlikely to exceed a few thousand, expected maximum search times of a few seconds is reasonable.
- **Time Complexity:** All functions were produced with time complexities equal to or better than linear. Both functions that necessitated iteration through the entire list of courses are linear, while all others were logarithmic. The ValidateAllCourses() function is the exception, utilizing a logarithmic time inner function to search for the given prerequisites wrapped in a linear time function to fully iterate the course BST.<br><br>

**List of new class functions:**
- BinarySearchTree::ToggleCourse()
- BinarySearchTree::ValidateAllCourses() (includes recursive function overload)
- AdvisingProgram::addCourse()
- AdvisingProgram::toggleCourse()<br><br>

By performing the actions above, the resulting program exemplifies the design and evaluation of computing solutions that solve a given problem. Trade-offs for functionality versus complexity have been managed, and the overall program is more capable with no loss to efficiency or performance.<br><br>

**REFLECTION**<br>
Successful feature addition is always an enjoyable experience. While this particular development cycle did necessitate overcoming a few hurdles, none were insurmountable or overtly cumbersome and primarily revolved around language syntax mistakes. No major challenges were noted.
The result of this phase has been a greater appreciation for planning and preparation prior to execution of development; the fact that this stage went well can be primarily attributed to these acts.

**5. ENHANCEMENT 3: Databases**

**ARTIFACT SELECTION**
- **Artifact:** ABCU Advising Program
- **Description:** This program provides course list storage for the CS department at ABCU (fictional) to assist with admissions and administrative functions.
- **Justification:**  This artifact was included for the opportunity it provided for holistic application development and iterative improvement. As a complete application with all code available and minimal external library dependency, exercises in improvement would be easily comprehensible and understandable. In addition, this program originally had no database structure or associated access logic, providing an excellent stage for building this component from the ground up.<br>

**PROCESS**<br>
**Course Outcome Exemplified: #5 - Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources**<br>
Exemplification of this outcome is accomplished via implementation of a credential-based access gateway to the program and storage of all program data within a MySQL database. Credentials are not stored anywhere in the program; instead, the MySQL database authentication is utilized. The use input is also obfuscated using ‘*’ characters as they type in their password. Additionally, all MySQL queries are handled using query execution functions included in the MySQL C++ Connector libraries. This protects the program against potential SQL injection attacks.<br><br>

**How artifact was improved:**
- MySQL database integration was added to the program, providing an external means of data storage as well as leveraging the database’s credential mechanism for program access. 
- Database structure:
  - Schema: course_database
  - Tables:
    - courses
      - id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
      - course_id VARCHAR(50)
      - description VARCHAR(100)
      - PRIMARY KEY(id)
    - prerequisites
      - id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
      - course_id INT
      - prerequisite_id INT
      - PRIMARY KEY(id)
      - FOREIGN KEY course_id REFERENCES courses(id)
      - FOREIGN KEY prerequisite_id REFERENCES courses(id)<br><br>

**Altered functions:**<br>
- **Main program:** the main() function was augmented with an additional subfunction getDBConnection() that prompts the user for their access credentials. It then uses these credentials to establish the connection with the local MySQL database. Failure of this mechanism precludes execution of the program entirely.
- **LoadCourses():** Loading of the active memory data structure has been changed from CSV file parsing to pulling course data from the database. This is done via two queries: all courses are first loaded from the course table, then prerequisites are set based on the associated table. This function also includes a clearing of the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure upon each execution to promote a single-source-of-truth paradigm.
- AddCourses() now employs two additional validations. First, the course to be added is passed into a check against the courses table in the database. If found, execution is interrupted. The same check is done with each entered prerequisite, except the inverse verification is done to ensure the course does exist. Finally, once an entry is confirmed by the user, the new course and prerequisite entries are inserted into the database along with the BST.
- A new supporting function getNode() has been added to the BinarySearchTree. This returns a Node pointer, allowing the prerequisites of a Course in the BST to be updated in the LoadCourses() function.<br><br>

By performing the actions above, the resulting program utilizes a database to store relevant data in a secure location as well as implementing more advanced relational database functions such as primary and secondary keys. Access is controlled by way of database credentials that could be managed by a Database Administrator or an external security program, and protection against the most likely avenue of malicious attack (SQL injections) is provided.<br><br>

**REFLECTION**<br>
Establishment of a new MySQL database instance was a valuable experience. While I’ve worked with MSSQL databases professionally, establishing a new one is a rare occurrence in my daily work. While I did encounter some OS-oriented issues during implementation, I was able to overcome these with research into the process and the official documentation provided by MySQL.  The process was both educational and enjoyable.
